        <h2><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h2>
        <p>This recipe is a variation on traditional chicken piquant, which is<em> spicy Cajun chicken</em>. This comes together quickly and is good served over white rice.</p>
       <h3><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></h3>
     <ul>
         <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li> 
         <li>½ teaspoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's)</li>
         <li>1 (16 ounce) package boneless, skinless chicken breast tenders</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>    
         <li>1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL)</li>     
         <li>¼ cup diced sweet pickles</li>      
         <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>      
         <li>2 tablespoons drained capers</li>

     <h3><strong>STEPS</strong></h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Mix flour and Creole seasoning together in a shallow bowl. Dredge chicken through flour mixture, shaking of excess. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Add diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, pickles, vinegar, capers, and garlic; simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C</li>
